# # Zillow Regression Project
Mack McGlenn, O'neil Cohort

### Project Overview
_____________________________________________________________________________________
This project will identify key drivers in determining tax value from the 2017 Zillow property dataset. Those drivers will then be taken to create a regression model which will best predict a home's future tax value.

**Objectives**

- Document code, process (data acquistion, preparation, exploratory data analysis and statistical testing, modeling, and model evaluation), findings, and key takeaways in a Jupyter notebook final report.

- Create modules (wrangle.py) that make your process repeateable and your report (notebook) easier to read and follow.

- Ask exploratory questions of your data that will help you understand more about the attributes and drivers of home value. Answer questions through charts and statistical tests.

- Construct a model to predict assessed home value for single family properties using regression techniques.

- Make recommendations to a data science team about how to improve predictions.

**Business Goals**

- Construct an ML Regression model that predicts propery tax assessed values ('taxvaluedollarcnt') of Single Family Properties using attributes of the properties.

- Find the key drivers of property value for single family properties.

**Deliverables**

- a complete readme.md
- a final report (.ipynb)
- wrangle.py
- exploratory workbook


### Project Planning

_____________________________________________________________________________________

#### Outline:
1. Acquire & Prepare Data
2. Exploration/ Correlation Analysis
3. Statistical Analysis
4. Preprocessing
5. Modeling
6. Conclusion

_____________________________________________________________________________________


## 1. Acquire & Prepare

#### Acquire
- Data acquired from CodeUp Database using get_zillow() function 
-  1500000 rows Ã— 9 columns
- metrics called: bedroomcnt, bathroomcnt,
calculatedfinishedsquarefeet, fips, lotsizesquarefeet,
 taxvaluedollarcnt, yearbuilt, assessmentyear, taxamount
#### Prepare Actions:
- Drop null values from columns
- Rename columns for ease of delivery
- Feature engineered new metric called 'yard_sqft' 
- Reassign values in 'fips' column to new variable called 'county', which returns the names of the county where the homes are being evaluated
- Created dummy variables for 'county' column
- Remove outliers from dataset
- Split data into train/val/test datasets

#### Functions called from wrangle.py:
1. get_zillow()
2. prep_zillow(df)
3. remove_outliers(df, columns)
4. split_zillow(df)


## 2. Exploration/ Correlation Analysis

Here are the steps I took during the exploration phase:

- Measure the distribution of my target variable (tax_val) in my train dataset
- Use spearmans's correlation to determine how my features relate to and impact my target variable
- Visualize that correlation via a heatmap and barplot

#### Functions called from wrangle.py:
1. show_corr(train)



## 3. Statistical Analysis

**Questions Addressed:**

1. Do homes with more bathrooms have higher tax values?
2. How does yard size effect tax value?
3. Does county location effect tax value?

**Methodology:**
1. Do homes with more bathrooms have higher tax values?
    - Null Hypothesis: Homes with more bathrooms will not have higher tax values than homes with less bathrooms
    - Hypothesis: Homes with more bathrooms will have higher tax values than homes with less values
    Test: T-test
    Results:
    - p < a
    - Reject the null hypothesis
    - Returns the average price of homes with 2 or less/ 2 or more bathrooms
    
2. How does yard size effect tax value?
    - H^O: Larger yard size decreases tax value.
    - Hypothesis: Larger yard size increases tax value.
    Test: ANOVA
    Results:
    - p < a, F-statistic: 2485.98
    - Reject the null hypothesis
    
3. Does county location effect tax value?
    - H^O: Tax value means will be equal across all three counties.
    - Hypothesis: Tax values will be very different across all three counties.
   Test: f_oneway
   Results:
    - p< a
    - Reject the null hypothesis
    - Returns the mean and median tax value of homes in all three counties
